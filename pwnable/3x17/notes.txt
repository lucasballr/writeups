No symbols
Can't find stack canary but there is one
No buffer overflow
No RWX locations


Process:
Writes "addr:" to stdout
Reads a 24 character buffer
Converts 24 characters into an integer
Writes "data:" to stdout
Reads another 24 character buffer to location specified by previous integer

Potential exploit:
Find GOT entries.
Overwrite an entry that has not been loaded
Not sure what's next

Potential function to overwrite: 0x40f940

I'm missing something here that's essential to controlling the flow of the program.
